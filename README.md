# Taylor SwiftUI

## Summary
Join me on a journey to learn Swift UI by creating an app to browse the discography of Taylor Swift.

Each branch in this repo shall move us closer to our goal of an amazing project, so far we are quite far from being there.

### 01- the basics.
In my first day on Taylor SwiftUI, I write my very first SwiftUI code, creating a simple list -> detail view that displays a list of albums which then takes us into a detail view of the album with a simple full screen image of art work.
A new view model struct called Album is created to contain our basic album info and a DataService is established and bound to our ListView to load the data.
Currently everything is hard coded.
Next up... loading from the itunes connect api??
